=============

Run this command and hope to hell most of the work is done for you

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanema/dotfiles/master/Makefile -o Makefile
make all
```

This was split up into a make file so that if `all` does not successfully finish then
I can run the other step individually
