#install mutt with sidebar have to patch with sidebar 
brew edit mutt
#then I scrolled down to a section of commands that all start with "option", sort of like:
option "with-debug", "Build with debug option enabled"
#I then added a line at the bottom of this block
option "with-sidebar-patch", "Apply sidebar patch"
#After that I scrolled down further to the section with all the patches, e.g.
#And I added the patch for sidebar (as I found here: https://github.com/kevwil/homebrew-patches/blob/master/mutt.rb)
patch do

#Finally, exit the editor for the brew file and in the commandline:
brew install mutt --with-sidebar-patch
